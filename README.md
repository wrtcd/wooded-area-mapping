# Alabama Tree Cover / Canopy Mapping (GEE)

State-scale tree cover mapping for Alabama using **Google Earth Engine**: Sentinel-2, Landsat, and optionally GEDI. Free data, lightweight methods, tiled export.

- **Spec & scope**: [PROJECT_SPEC.md](PROJECT_SPEC.md) — goals, data, directions, next steps.
- **Boundary**: [PROJECT_BOUNDARY.md](PROJECT_BOUNDARY.md) — what we do and don’t do (no PlanetScope, no per-scene U-Net).

Start with PROJECT_SPEC.md.
